# hacktoberfest2020

This is a beginner friendly repo for HacktoberFest 2020. The idea here is to push code you find interesting, maybe a cool problem you solved or a webpage you made - anything goes!

Please push only original work :)

# Instructions for Creating A Pull Request

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the repo you just forked

```shell
git clone <link to the forked repo>
```

3. Create a new branch on your clone

```shell
git chekout -b <your branch name>
```

4. Add your changes in a new folder with a relevant name (avoid using your GitHub handle, the folder's name should ideally describe the work you have done)
5. Create a commit

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
```

6. Push your changes to your remote server

```shell
git push origin <your branch name>
```

7. Send your pull request. As long as it's cool and original I'll merge it :)
